# 🏢 Earthquake Damage Prediction

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build an **End-to-End machine learning model** that can predict whether a specific building is likely to suffer **severe damage** during an earthquake.

We're using a structured SQLite database, doing data wrangling with SQL, and using Python to build, train, and evaluate the ML model.

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project includes the following key steps:

1. **Connect to a SQLite database** that contains building and earthquake data.
2. **Explore and clean the data** using SQL queries.
3. **Bring the SQL output into a Pandas DataFrame** for further processing.
4. **Prepare the data for machine learning**, including feature engineering.
5. **Train and evaluate ML models** to make predictions on earthquake damage.
